7.x-1.x
=======

Purpose
-------

Prevent the site builder from having to remember to change certain
site variables when then migrate content between dev, test and live
environments.

Branches
--------

The drupal.org git strategy is not to use the master branch.  Click on
the github Branches tab to get to the 6.x and 7.x branches. The
READMEs on the branches are a lot more entertaining.
